Building fluency with neural networks.

Simple PyTorch-based Neural Network implementation from scratch in Python.

SOAP optimizer is implemented to have exposure to modern (quasi-) second order optimization methods.

Many different layers are implemented in layers.py, including vanilla fully connected layers, convolution layers, and recurrent layers.
