# TicTacToe MCTS Implementation

This repository contains a toy TicTacToe implementation using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with neural network guidance. The implementation demonstrates key concepts in game AI and reinforcement learning.

## Project Structure

- `tictactoe.cpp` - Core game logic and MCTS implementation in C++
- `tictactoe_net.py` - PyTorch neural network for policy and value prediction
- `tictactoe_train.py` - Training script for the neural network
- `tictactoe_play.py` - Interactive play script against the trained agent

## Key Features

- Monte Carlo Tree Search with neural network guidance
- Policy and value prediction using a simple neural network
- C++ core engine for fast MCTS simulation
- Python interface for training and playing
