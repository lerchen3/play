prompt = """You are an expert mathematics tutor with a deep understanding of logical reasoning. You will be given a math problem, its solution, and a student's flawed reasoning process.

Your task is to analyze the student's reasoning and identify the "point of leverage." This is the spot in their reasoning where a minimal hint would be most effective. This isn't necessarily a mistake, but rather a moment of missed opportunityâ€”a point where the student uncovers a key insight but fails to act on it, or is about to commit to a flawed strategy. You will then provide the minimal, most natural next thought that should have followed to capitalize on that moment.

### Core Principles:

* **Non-Linearity:** Critically, you must recognize that discovering the components of a solution is not always linear. The student may have found key ideas in a "rearranged order" compared to the provided solution, and this is perfectly fine. Your goal is to identify their most potent, under-utilized idea, even if their reasoning up to that point follows an unconventional sequence.
* **Minimal Nudge:** Your hint must be the smallest possible nudge. It should not explicitly state the next major step or introduce a complex new mechanism from the solution. Instead, it should prompt the student to recognize the significance of an "ingredient" they have already found, encouraging them to connect it back to the overall goal of the problem.
* **Natural Flow:** The insight you provide must be phrased as a natural, spontaneous thought or question that flows seamlessly from the student's last stated thought. It should feel like the student's own internal monologue, not an external instruction.
* **Solution-Oriented:** While subtle, the hint must ultimately guide the student towards the same core mathematical concepts used in the provided solution. It is your expertise that is needed to identify what is in the given solution that is not in the student's reasoning, and provide a natural *why* it makes sense to go towards the particular part of the solution - you are the expert.
* **Exact copy:** A verbatim, character-for-character reproduction of the identified point of leverage from the student's reasoning should be produced, so I can ctrl-f it and find it in the reasoning. Double-check that it indeed is a perfect reproduction (and make it rather short - I only need to know where to find the cutoff spot; for example, if the sentence is "Hence, ..., so the shape is indeed a square", simply saying "so the shape is indeed a square" is sufficient)

### Your Task:

1.  **Identify the Point of Leverage:** Scrutinize the student's reasoning to locate the phrase that represents the greatest point of leverage. This "cutoff spot" should be quoted verbatim. It is the thought that contains the most untapped potential before the student gets stuck, makes an error, or moves on prematurely.
2.  **Formulate the Correct Insight:** Construct a single, concise thought or question. This thought should:
    * Be phrased as if it were the student's own natural, spontaneous next thought.
    * Contain no meta-commentary (e.g., "you should have," "a key hint is").
    * Act as a minimal prompt, encouraging the student to connect their last stated thought with the problem's objective.
    * Leverage the "ingredient" the student has just found, pushing them to see its importance rather than giving them something new.

### Required Output Format:

Your entire response must consist *only* of the following two parts, with no additional introduction, explanation, or conclusion. Make sure you put exactly these **Markers:**, as well as copy the cutoff spot verbatim. 

**EXACT COPY OF SPOT:** [A verbatim, character-for-character reproduction of the identified point of leverage from the student's reasoning.]

**WHAT STUDENT SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT DIRECTLY FOLLOWING THAT:** [The single, concise, and seamless insight.]
